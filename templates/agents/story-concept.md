# 📋 Story Concept

## Model Assignment

**Model**: Sonnet (thorough analysis for story clarity)
**Cost per Action**: ~$0.003
**Never Calls**: No other concepts (pure input processing)

## Core Principle: Polymorphic Independence

This concept works for ANY requirements system - user stories, use cases, specifications, etc. It has NO knowledge of:
- How architecture works
- How implementation happens
- What quality checks exist
- Git workflows

This enforces true modularity. The concept can be replaced or upgraded without affecting anything else.

## Actions

### create(title, description, context)

Captures a new user requirement.

**Inputs**:
- `title`: Brief summary of the requirement
- `description`: Detailed explanation of what's needed
- `context`: Background, motivation, user impact

**Process**:
1. Parse and structure the requirement
2. Generate initial acceptance criteria
3. Identify ambiguities or missing information
4. Save via `zen_story_save` MCP tool (persists to SQLite state.db)

**Outputs**:
- `story_id`: Unique identifier
- `status`: "draft", "ready", or "needs_clarification"
- `acceptance_criteria`: List of verifiable conditions
- `ambiguities`: List of unclear points (if any)

**Output Format** (YAML with Progressive Disclosure):

```yaml
story_id: "story-001"
status: "ready"
summary: "User can authenticate via OAuth2 with Google provider"

details:
  title: "Add OAuth authentication"
  description: |
    Users should be able to log in using their Google accounts
    instead of creating new credentials.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - User sees "Sign in with Google" button on login page
    - Clicking button redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
    - After consent, user is redirected back and logged in
    - User profile is created/updated with Google account info

  context:
    motivation: "Reduce friction in signup process"
    user_impact: "Faster onboarding, no password to remember"
    constraints: "Must comply with Google OAuth 2.0 spec"

  ambiguities: []

  metadata:
    created_at: "2025-11-11T10:30:00Z"
    created_by: "user"
    concept: "story"
    model: "sonnet"
    cost: 0.003
```

### validate(story_id)

Validates that a story is complete and ready.

**Inputs**:
- `story_id`: Story to validate

**Process**:
1. Check for required fields
2. Verify acceptance criteria are testable
3. Identify missing information
4. Update status

**Outputs**:
- `status`: "ready", "needs_clarification", or "blocked"
- `issues`: List of problems found
- `recommendations`: Suggestions for improvement

## State Management

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

All story outputs use the progressive disclosure pattern:

**Summary Section** (first 5 lines):
- `story_id`: Unique identifier
- `status`: Current state (draft/ready/needs_clarification)
- `summary`: One-line description of the requirement

**Details Section** (loaded on demand):
- Complete requirement information
- Full acceptance criteria
- Context and constraints
- Metadata and provenance

### State Location

Stories are saved via the `zen_story_save` MCP tool to SQLite (`koan/state/state.db`).
Use `zen_story_get` to retrieve a story by ID, or `zen_story_list` to list all stories.

### Status Values

- `draft`: Initial capture, may need refinement
- `ready`: Complete and validated, ready for architecture
- `needs_clarification`: Missing information, user input required
- `blocked`: Cannot proceed without external dependency

## Integration with Synchronizations

The story concept is triggered by:
- User commands (`/feature`)
- Direct invocation (`/story "description"`)

The story concept triggers (via synchronizations):
- `architecture` concept when status = "ready"
- User notification when status = "needs_clarification"

## Validation Rules

Story is "ready" when:
- [ ] Title is clear and concise (<100 chars)
- [ ] Description explains what and why
- [ ] At least 2 acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Context provides necessary background
- [ ] No blocking ambiguities

## Error Handling

If story capture fails:
1. Save partial state with status="draft"
2. Document what information is missing
3. Return clear error message to user
4. Do not trigger downstream concepts

## Never Do This

- ❌ Call other concepts directly
- ❌ Implement any code
- ❌ Make architecture decisions
- ❌ Run tests or quality checks
- ❌ Perform git operations

## Always Do This

- ✅ Use Sonnet model exclusively
- ✅ Save state via zen_story_save MCP tool
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure format
- ✅ Validate before marking "ready"
- ✅ Document ambiguities clearly
- ✅ Track cost and duration in metadata
- ✅ Follow YAML safety rules (see below)

## YAML Safety Rules

All YAML output MUST follow these rules to prevent silent parse failures:

1. **Quote strings containing special characters.** Any string with `@`, `#`, `:`, `{`, `[`, `"`, `!`, `*`, `&`, `|`, `>`, or `%` must be wrapped in double quotes with inner quotes escaped.
2. **Avoid nested quotes in unquoted list items.** If a list item (`- ...`) contains embedded double quotes, wrap the entire value in double quotes and escape the inner quotes, or remove the inner quotes.
3. **Use block scalars for long text.** Multi-line strings and strings with special characters should use `|` (literal) or `>` (folded) block scalar syntax.
4. **Validate output parses.** Before saving, mentally verify the YAML is valid — unquoted `@scope/package` or unmatched `"` will cause silent load failures downstream.
