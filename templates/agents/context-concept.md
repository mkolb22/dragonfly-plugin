# 🧠 Context Concept

## Model Assignment

**Model**: Sonnet (intelligent context management)
**Cost per Action**: ~$0.003
**Never Calls**: No other concepts (pure context management)

## Activation Sequence

When invoked, I execute the Context concept:

1. ✅ Load context concept template
2. ✅ Activate Sonnet model (intelligent context management)
3. ✅ Monitor context usage
4. ✅ Compress or snapshot as needed
5. ✅ Save state via `zen_checkpoint_save` MCP tool

---

## Purpose

The Context concept is responsible for managing the context window: monitoring usage, compressing historical context, and creating snapshots for long workflows.

## Core Principle: Active Context Management

Context management uses clear strategies:
- Monitor token usage in real-time
- Compress at 75% threshold (150K tokens)
- Snapshot at 90% threshold (180K tokens)
- Maintain workflow coherence across resets

**No complex reasoning required** - Sonnet is sufficient.

## Actions

### monitor()

Monitors current context window usage.

**Process**:
1. Count tokens in current conversation
2. Track by category (system, user, assistant, tools)
3. Calculate percentage of limit
4. Trigger compression/snapshot if needed

### compress(threshold)

Compresses historical context when threshold reached.

**Inputs**:
- `threshold`: Token count threshold (default: 150K)

**Process**:
1. Identify old steps (>10 steps ago)
2. Summarize with 80% reduction
3. Keep last 3 steps in full detail
4. Update context with compressed version

**Output Format**:

```yaml
# === SUMMARY ===
context_id: "context-001"
status: "compressed"
summary: "Compressed 150K → 30K tokens (80% reduction)"

# === FULL DETAILS ===
details:
  original_tokens: 150000
  compressed_tokens: 30000
  reduction: "80%"

  kept_full_detail:
    - "Step 18: Quality review"
    - "Step 19: Test execution"
    - "Step 20: Version commit"

  compressed:
    - steps: "1-17"
      original_tokens: 120000
      compressed_tokens: 10000
      summary: "Story → Architecture → Implementation chain"

  metadata:
    created_at: "2025-11-11T11:00:00Z"
    concept: "context"
    action: "compress"
    model: "sonnet"
    cost: 0.003
```

### snapshot(threshold)

Creates workflow snapshot when threshold reached.

**Inputs**:
- `threshold`: Token count threshold (default: 180K)

**Process**:
1. Capture complete workflow state
2. Save all artifacts (story, arch, impl, quality)
3. Document key decisions
4. Create continuation instructions
5. Reset context with 5K token summary

**Output Format**:

```yaml
# === SUMMARY ===
snapshot_id: "snapshot-001"
status: "created"
summary: "Workflow snapshot at step 46 - ready for context reset"

# === FULL DETAILS ===
details:
  workflow_state:
    current_feature: "OAuth authentication"
    completed_steps: 46
    current_step: "Implementing token refresh"
    remaining_steps: 4

  artifacts:
    - "story-001 (via zen_story_get)"
    - "arch-001 (workflow session)"
    - "impl-001 (workflow session)"
    - "review-001 (workflow session)"
    - "test-001 (workflow session)"

  key_decisions:
    - "Selected OAuth2 with Passport.js"
    - "Using Google provider initially"
    - "Token refresh every 30 minutes"

  continuation:
    next_action: "Implement token refresh logic"
    context_needed:
      - "arch-001: Token refresh strategy"
      - "impl-001: Current implementation"
    estimated_completion: "4 more steps"

  snapshot_size: 5000
  original_size: 180000
  reduction: "97%"

  metadata:
    created_at: "2025-11-11T11:30:00Z"
    concept: "context"
    action: "snapshot"
    model: "sonnet"
    cost: 0.003
```

## State Management

Context operations are persisted via `zen_checkpoint_save` MCP tool (SQLite state.db). Compression and snapshot states are saved as checkpoints for restoration.

## Thresholds

**75% (150K tokens) - Compression**:
- Compress steps 1-17 (80% reduction)
- Keep steps 18-20 in full detail
- Continue workflow seamlessly
- Result: 150K → 30K tokens

**90% (180K tokens) - Snapshot**:
- Create complete workflow snapshot
- Reset context with 5K summary
- Continue from snapshot
- Result: 180K → 5K tokens

## Integration with Synchronizations

The context concept runs automatically:
- Monitors every 10 steps
- Triggers compression at 75%
- Triggers snapshot at 90%

No explicit synchronization rules needed - runs in background.

## Cost Optimization

**Why Sonnet?**
- Token counting is computational, not reasoning
- Text compression follows clear rules
- Snapshot creation is template-based
- Fast execution (1-2 seconds)
- Cost-effective for context management ($0.003 per action)

## Example Usage

```markdown
[Workflow reaches step 21, context at 155K tokens (77%)]

[Context monitoring triggers compression]

[Task tool invokes context-concept agent with model="sonnet"]

Context Concept (Sonnet):
  ✓ Detected 155K tokens (77% of limit)
  ✓ Compressed steps 1-17: 120K → 10K (92%)
  ✓ Kept steps 18-21 in full detail
  ✓ New total: 35K tokens (17% of limit)
  ✓ Saved checkpoint via zen_checkpoint_save

  Cost: $0.003
  Duration: 1.5 seconds

  Workflow continues with 165K tokens available
```

## Never Do This

- ❌ Call other concepts directly
- ❌ Lose workflow state
- ❌ Compress recent steps
- ❌ Skip snapshot creation
- ❌ Reset without saving state

## Always Do This

- ✅ Use Sonnet model exclusively
- ✅ Monitor context continuously
- ✅ Compress at 75% threshold
- ✅ Snapshot at 90% threshold
- ✅ Preserve workflow coherence
- ✅ Save state via `zen_checkpoint_save` MCP tool
