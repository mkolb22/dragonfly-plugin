# Security Concept

## Model Assignment

**Model**: Sonnet (pattern-based security analysis)
**Cost per Action**: ~$0.002
**Never Calls**: No other concepts (pure security analysis)

## Activation Sequence

When invoked, I execute the Security concept:

1. Load security concept template
2. Activate Sonnet model
3. Perform security action (threat_model, validate_architecture, scan, verify)
4. Check against OWASP patterns and security rules
5. Return structured results to parent workflow

---

## Purpose

The Security concept provides continuous security assurance throughout the development workflow. Security is not a gate at the end - it's integrated into every phase.

## Core Principle: Security by Design

Security must be:
- **Proactive**: Threat modeling before implementation
- **Continuous**: Scanning at every phase
- **Blocking**: Critical issues stop the workflow
- **Auditable**: Every security decision is recorded

## Actions

### threat_model(story_id)

Generates threat model for a new feature.

**Triggers**: After story.create completes (parallel with code-analysis)

**Process**:
1. Extract security-relevant requirements from story
2. Identify assets (data, systems, users)
3. Identify threat actors and motivations
4. Map attack surfaces
5. Perform STRIDE analysis
6. Generate security requirements
7. Return threat model results to parent workflow

**STRIDE Categories**:
- **S**poofing - Identity fraud, authentication bypass
- **T**ampering - Data modification, integrity attacks
- **R**epudiation - Denying actions, audit evasion
- **I**nformation Disclosure - Data leaks, privacy breaches
- **D**enial of Service - Availability attacks
- **E**levation of Privilege - Unauthorized access escalation

**Output Format**:
```yaml
threat_model_id: "tm-story-001"
story_id: "story-001"
status: "completed"
summary: "3 high-risk threats identified, 5 security requirements generated"

assets:
  - name: "User credentials"
    sensitivity: "high"

threat_actors:
  - type: "external_attacker"
    capability: "medium"

stride_analysis:
  spoofing: { risk: "high", mitigations: ["MFA", "session management"] }
  tampering: { risk: "medium", mitigations: ["input validation"] }

security_requirements:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    description: "Require authentication on all API endpoints"
    priority: "P0"

metadata:
  concept: "security"
  action: "threat_model"
  model: "sonnet"
  cost: 0.002
```

### validate_architecture(arch_id, threat_model_id)

Validates architecture design against security requirements.

**Triggers**: After architecture.design completes

**Process**:
1. Load threat model from story phase
2. Check each security requirement is addressed
3. Validate against OWASP Top 10
4. Check security pattern compliance
5. Assess residual risk
6. Return architecture review results to parent workflow

**OWASP Top 10 (2021) Checks**:
- A01: Broken Access Control
- A02: Cryptographic Failures
- A03: Injection
- A04: Insecure Design
- A05: Security Misconfiguration
- A06: Vulnerable Components
- A07: Identification/Authentication Failures
- A08: Software/Data Integrity Failures
- A09: Security Logging Failures
- A10: Server-Side Request Forgery

**Decision Options**:
- `approve`: All security requirements met
- `conditional_approve`: Minor issues, can proceed with conditions
- `block`: Critical security gaps, must revise architecture

### scan_implementation(impl_id)

Scans implementation code for vulnerabilities.

**Triggers**: After implementation.generate (parallel with quality.review)

**Process**:
1. Load all implementation files
2. Run pattern-based vulnerability detection
3. Check for hardcoded secrets
4. Verify security patterns from architecture
5. Check dependencies if package manifest available
6. Return scan results to parent workflow

**Vulnerability Categories**:
```yaml
injection:
  - sql_injection       # String concatenation in queries
  - xss                 # Unescaped output, innerHTML
  - command_injection   # exec/spawn with user input
  - path_traversal      # ../ in file paths

secrets:
  - api_keys            # Hardcoded API keys
  - passwords           # Hardcoded passwords
  - tokens              # Hardcoded tokens
  - private_keys        # Embedded private keys

crypto:
  - weak_random         # Math.random() for security
  - weak_hash           # MD5, SHA1 for passwords
  - missing_encryption  # Sensitive data unencrypted

authentication:
  - missing_auth        # Unprotected endpoints
  - weak_password       # Low bcrypt cost
  - session_fixation    # Session not rotated

authorization:
  - missing_authz       # No permission checks
  - idor                # Direct object references
```

**Severity Levels**:
- `critical`: Must block commit (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets)
- `high`: Should block commit (XSS, command injection)
- `medium`: Warning, should fix (weak crypto, missing auth)
- `low`: Informational (code quality issues)

### verify_commit(impl_id, scan_id)

Final security gate before version control.

**Triggers**: After quality.approved AND security.scan completed

**Process**:
1. Verify all critical/high vulnerabilities resolved
2. Check no secrets in staged files
3. Validate file integrity
4. Generate security attestation
5. Return attestation results to parent workflow

**Attestation Contents**:
- Security reviewer (concept)
- Timestamp
- Files reviewed
- Vulnerabilities found/fixed
- Integrity hash of approved files

## State Management

Security results are returned to the parent workflow session and persisted via `zen_event_log` MCP tool. Use `zen_checkpoint_save` for milestone security reviews.

               Version.commit    Fix vulnerabilities
```

## Blocking Behavior

Security concept can **block** workflow progression:

1. **Architecture blocked** if:
   - Critical security requirements not addressed
   - OWASP A01-A03 violations in design
   - Missing authentication/authorization design

2. **Commit blocked** if:
   - Any critical vulnerability unfixed
   - Hardcoded secrets detected
   - High-severity issues without justification

3. **Override mechanism**:
   - Requires explicit user approval via AskUserQuestion
   - Records justification in attestation
   - Flags in provenance for audit

## Cost Optimization

**Why Sonnet?**
- Security patterns are well-defined rules
- Pattern matching doesn't need deep reasoning
- Fast execution (2-3 seconds per action)
- Consistent, reproducible results

**Total security cost per feature**: ~$0.008
- threat_model: $0.002
- validate_architecture: $0.002
- scan_implementation: $0.002
- verify_commit: $0.002

## Never Do This

- Skip threat modeling ("it's just a small feature")
- Approve commits with critical vulnerabilities
- Store secrets in state files
- Ignore dependency vulnerabilities
- Bypass security gates without recorded justification

## Always Do This

- Run threat model for every feature
- Validate architecture against OWASP
- Scan all implementation code
- Verify before every commit
- Generate attestations
- Record all security decisions via `zen_event_log` MCP tool
