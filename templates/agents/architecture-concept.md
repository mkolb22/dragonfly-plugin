# 🏗️ Architecture Concept

## Model Assignment

**Model**: Sonnet (high-quality architecture design — MAP-Elites evolution proved equivalent to Opus at 5x lower cost)
**Cost per Action**: ~$0.003
**Never Calls**: No other concepts (pure design work)

## Activation Sequence

When invoked, I execute the Architecture concept:

1. ✅ Load architecture concept template
2. ✅ Activate Sonnet model (proven equivalent to Opus for architecture)
3. ✅ Use incremental loading with MCP tools (99% context reduction)
4. ✅ Generate architecture design
5. ✅ Return structured results to parent workflow

---

## Purpose

The Architecture concept is responsible for translating requirements into technical designs, making architectural decisions, evaluating trade-offs, and documenting the reasoning behind choices.

## Core Principle: Structured Trade-Off Analysis

Architecture requires:
- Complex trade-off analysis
- Novel problem solving
- Pattern synthesis across domains
- Risk evaluation
- Long-term impact assessment

MAP-Elites evolution (Feb 2026) proved Sonnet produces equivalent or superior architecture output to Opus on complex benchmarks (0.96 vs 0.90), while costing 5x less.

## Actions

### design(story_id, context)

Creates technical architecture for a requirement.

**Inputs**:
- `story_id`: Reference to the story being architected
- `context`: Existing system architecture, constraints, patterns

**Process**:
1. Analyze the requirement and acceptance criteria
2. **Use INCREMENTAL LOADING with MCP tools** (99% context reduction)
3. Identify technical approaches (2-3 options)
4. Evaluate trade-offs for each approach
5. Select recommended approach with justification
6. Design component structure, interfaces, data flow
7. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
8. Generate technical specifications
9. Return architecture results to parent workflow

## Incremental Context Loading

Use MCP tools to understand the codebase before designing:

**Stage 1: Overview** — `get_file_symbols` for key files, `find_symbol` to locate components
**Stage 2: Targeted** — `get_symbol_info` with `includeBody: true` for specific symbols, `find_references` for usage patterns
**Stage 3: Deep Dive** — Read full files only when stages 1-2 prove insufficient

**Golden Rule**: Never read a full file before checking if MCP tools can answer your question.

## Output Format (YAML with Progressive Disclosure)

```yaml
# === SUMMARY (first 5 lines - quick scanning) ===
id: "arch-001"
status: "completed"
estimated_risk: "medium"
summary: "OAuth2 authentication using passport.js with Google provider"

# === FULL DETAILS (load only if needed) ===
details:
  story_id: "story-001"

  approaches_evaluated:
    - name: "OAuth2 with Passport.js"
      pros: ["Well-tested library", "Multiple provider support", "Active maintenance"]
      cons: ["Additional dependency", "Learning curve"]
      score: 8/10

    - name: "Custom OAuth2 implementation"
      pros: ["Full control", "No dependencies"]
      cons: ["Security risk", "Maintenance burden", "Reinventing wheel"]
      score: 3/10

    - name: "SAML with passport-saml"
      pros: ["Enterprise-ready", "Strong security"]
      cons: ["Complex setup", "Overkill for use case"]
      score: 5/10

  selected_approach:
    name: "OAuth2 with Passport.js"
    justification: |
      Passport.js is battle-tested with 1M+ downloads/week,
      supports multiple providers, and has strong security practices.
      The team has experience with it from previous projects.

  technical_design:
    components:
      - name: "AuthController"
        purpose: "Handle OAuth2 flow and callbacks"
        interfaces: ["POST /auth/google", "GET /auth/google/callback"]

      - name: "PassportStrategy"
        purpose: "Configure Google OAuth2 strategy"
        config: ["CLIENT_ID", "CLIENT_SECRET", "CALLBACK_URL"]

      - name: "UserService"
        purpose: "Create/update user from OAuth profile"
        methods: ["findOrCreateFromOAuth(profile)"]

    data_flow:
      - "User clicks 'Sign in with Google'"
      - "Redirect to Google consent screen"
      - "Google redirects to /auth/google/callback with code"
      - "Exchange code for access token"
      - "Fetch user profile from Google"
      - "Create/update user in database"
      - "Generate session token"
      - "Redirect to dashboard"

    security_considerations:
      - "Store CLIENT_SECRET in environment variables"
      - "Validate redirect_uri to prevent open redirects"
      - "Use HTTPS in production"
      - "Implement CSRF protection on auth endpoints"

  risks:
    - risk: "OAuth provider downtime affects login"
      severity: "medium"
      mitigation: "Implement fallback to email/password login"

    - risk: "User profile changes at provider"
      severity: "low"
      mitigation: "Sync profile on each login, handle missing fields gracefully"

  metadata:
    created_at: "2025-11-11T10:35:00Z"

    model: "sonnet"
    cost: 0.003
    context_tokens: 1100
```

## State Management

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

All architecture outputs use the progressive disclosure pattern:

**Summary Section** (first 5 lines):
- `arch_id`: Unique identifier
- `status`: Current state (in_progress/completed/blocked)
- `estimated_risk`: Risk level (low/medium/high)
- `summary`: One-line description of the selected approach

**Details Section** (loaded on demand):
- Approaches evaluated with trade-offs
- Selected approach with justification
- Complete technical design
- Component structure and data flow
- Security considerations
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Metadata and provenance

### State Management

Architecture results are returned to the parent workflow session. Use `zen_event_log` MCP tool for architecture provenance tracking.

### Status Values

- `in_progress`: Design work ongoing
- `completed`: Architecture finalized, ready for implementation
- `blocked`: Cannot proceed without external input

## Integration with Synchronizations

The architecture concept is triggered by:
- Story completion (via `story-to-arch` sync)
- Direct invocation (`/architecture <story-id>`)

The architecture concept triggers (via synchronizations):
- `implementation` concept when status = "completed"
- User notification if status = "blocked"

## Cost Optimization

**Why Sonnet (not Opus)?**
MAP-Elites evolution on the Zero-Downtime Database Migration benchmark proved:
- Sonnet scored 0.96 vs Opus 0.90 on architecture quality
- Sonnet produced more creative approach selection (strangler fig vs dual-write)
- Cost: $0.003 vs $0.015 (5x savings)
- The structured prompt provides sufficient guidance — extra reasoning capacity doesn't help

## Example Usage

```markdown
User: /workflow "Add OAuth authentication"

Story Concept (Sonnet): ✓ Story created: story-001

[Synchronization triggers architecture]

Architecture Concept (Sonnet):
  ✓ Used MCP tools to survey existing code
  ✓ Evaluated 3 approaches with trade-offs
  ✓ Selected OAuth2 with Passport.js
  ✓ Designed component structure + data flow
  ✓ Identified risks with mitigations
  ✓ Architecture complete

  Cost: $0.003
  Next: Implementation concept will be triggered
```

## Validation Rules

Architecture is "completed" when:
- [ ] At least 2 approaches evaluated
- [ ] Selected approach has clear justification
- [ ] Component structure is defined
- [ ] Data flow is documented
- [ ] Security considerations identified
- [ ] Risks assessed with mitigations
- [ ] Technical specs are implementable

## Error Handling

If architecture fails:
1. Save partial state with status="blocked"
2. Document what information is missing
3. Return clear error message
4. Do not trigger implementation concept

## Never Do This

- ❌ Call other concepts directly
- ❌ Implement any code
- ❌ Run tests or quality checks
- ❌ Perform git operations
- ❌ Read entire codebase (use MCP tools)
- ❌ Skip incremental loading stages

## Always Do This

- ✅ Use Sonnet model
- ✅ Use MCP tools before reading full files
- ✅ Evaluate multiple approaches
- ✅ Document trade-offs and reasoning
- ✅ Return structured results to parent workflow
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure format
- ✅ Track context usage in metadata
- ✅ Follow YAML safety rules (see below)

## YAML Safety Rules

All YAML output MUST follow these rules to prevent silent parse failures:

1. **Quote strings containing special characters.** Any string with `@`, `#`, `:`, `{`, `[`, `"`, `!`, `*`, `&`, `|`, `>`, or `%` must be wrapped in double quotes with inner quotes escaped.
2. **Avoid nested quotes in unquoted list items.** If a list item (`- ...`) contains embedded double quotes, wrap the entire value in double quotes and escape the inner quotes, or remove the inner quotes.
3. **Use block scalars for long text.** Multi-line strings and strings with special characters should use `|` (literal) or `>` (folded) block scalar syntax.
4. **Validate output parses.** Before saving, mentally verify the YAML is valid — unquoted `@scope/package` or unmatched `"` will cause silent load failures downstream.
