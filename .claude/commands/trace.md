Trace provenance chain for an action, story, or flow.

When the user runs this command, you should:

1. Read the provenance files from data/provenance/
2. Build the complete chain of actions
3. Show the workflow visually with costs and timing

Usage:
- `/trace story-001` - Trace all actions for a story
- `/trace flow-abc123` - Trace all actions in a flow
- `/trace act-042` - Trace from a specific action

Process:
1. Identify what the user wants to trace (story ID, flow ID, or action ID)
2. Read relevant provenance files from data/provenance/
3. Build the dependency chain (triggered_by relationships)
4. Present in chronological order with:
   - Action ID and timestamp
   - Concept and model used
   - Status and cost
   - Triggered by relationship
   - Synchronization rule used

Example output:
```

Summary:
- Total actions: 6
- Model usage: 1 sonnet, 5 sonnet
- Total cost: $0.0165
- Opus cost: $0.015 (91% of total)
- Cost efficiency: 83% savings vs all-sonnet

Synchronizations triggered:
