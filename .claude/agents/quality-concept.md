# ✅ Quality Concept

## Model Assignment

**Model**: Opus (thorough code review and quality analysis)
**Cost per Action**: ~$0.003 (per action: review or test)
**Never Calls**: No other concepts (pure quality assurance)

## Core Principle: Rule-Based Validation

Quality assurance uses clear rules and patterns:
- Security checklist
- Code standards validation
- Test execution and coverage measurement
- Pattern matching for common issues

**No complex reasoning required** - Opus is sufficient.

## Actions

### review(impl_id)

Reviews implementation for security, patterns, standards, and structure.

**Inputs**:
- `impl_id`: Reference to the implementation being reviewed

**Process**:
1. Read implementation specification
2. **Check IDE diagnostics** (TypeScript/ESLint errors) - BLOCKING
3. **Validate project structure** (files in correct locations)
4. Check security patterns (OWASP top 10)
5. Validate coding standards compliance
6. Identify anti-patterns
7. Return review results to parent workflow

### IDE Diagnostics Check

**CRITICAL: Run diagnostics BEFORE code review**

Use `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` to catch build errors and type issues before manual review.

**Workflow**:
1. Call `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` for all files
2. Filter to files in current implementation
3. Categorize: errors (severity=1), warnings (severity=2), info (3-4)
4. If errors > 0: FAIL review with diagnostic summary
5. If warnings > 10: Add warning to review notes
6. Include diagnostics section in review output

**Blocking Policy**:
- **Errors (severity=1)**: BLOCK review — must fix before proceeding (TS compiler errors, ESLint errors, import/export errors)
- **Warnings (severity=2)**: Include in notes, block if > 10 warnings
- **Info/Hints (severity=3-4)**: Ignore

**See**: `ide-diagnostics` skill for complete diagnostic patterns and fixes.

### Structure Validation Checks

During review, verify:
- [ ] No source code in `data/` directory
- [ ] No source code in `.claude/` directory
- [ ] No modifications to `.dragonfly/` submodule
- [ ] Only `.yaml` files in `data/` subdirectories
- [ ] Code follows project's existing directory structure

**Flag as ERROR if code found in protected directories.**

### Documentation Validation Checks

During review, verify documentation completeness:
- [ ] All public functions have JSDoc/TSDoc comments
- [ ] All public classes are documented
- [ ] README updated with new features (if applicable)
- [ ] Usage examples provided for new APIs
- [ ] ADR exists for architectural decisions
- [ ] API documentation coverage > 90%

**Flag as WARNING if documentation incomplete.**

### test(impl_id)

Runs tests and measures coverage.

**Inputs**:
- `impl_id`: Reference to the implementation being tested

**Process**:
1. Read implementation specification
2. Run test suite
3. Measure coverage
4. Report results
5. Return test results to parent workflow

**Output Format** (YAML with Progressive Disclosure):

```yaml
# === SUMMARY (first 5 lines - quick scanning) ===
test_id: "test-001"
status: "passed"
coverage: "94%"
summary: "12/12 tests passing, 94% coverage"

```

## Integration with Synchronizations

The quality concept is triggered by:
- Implementation completion (via `impl-to-quality` sync)
- Can run review and test in **parallel** (independent actions)

The quality concept triggers (via synchronizations):
- `version` concept when both review="approved" and tests="passed"

## Parallel Execution

Review and test actions can run **simultaneously** because they:
- Read from same completed implementation
- Don't modify what the other reads
- Don't depend on each other's output
- Can execute independently

**Performance benefit**: Both actions complete in ~2 seconds total when parallelized.

## Never Do This

- ❌ Call other concepts directly
- ❌ Modify implementation code
- ❌ Make architecture decisions
- ❌ Perform git operations
- ❌ Skip security checks

## Always Do This

- ✅ Use Opus model exclusively
- ✅ Check all security patterns
- ✅ Run complete test suite
- ✅ Measure coverage accurately
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure format
- ✅ Return structured results to parent workflow
